I'm creating a recipe website using HTML, i've done this before but i stopped around CSS for a while and procastinated, now i'm back stronger than ever and ready to speed blitz through all these lessons and catch up, it's way better this time cuz i really understand what the odin project is saying, plus, i'm coming into coding with a different mindset.

This is Exhilarating
